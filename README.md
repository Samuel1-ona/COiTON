# Decentralized Real Estate Trading Platform

This project aims to develop a Decentralized Real Estate Trading Platform that enables users to speculate on and trade city indices representing real estate markets. The platform will use blockchain technology to ensure transparency, security, and accessibility, allowing users to engage in trading without the need to own physical properties.
